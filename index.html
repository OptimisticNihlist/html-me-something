            Video games are a long time hobby of mine, and I have many fond memories of playing games on the Atari Jaguar (most notably, Primal Rage!)
            <img id="primal-rage" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f7/Primal_Rage_flyer.jpg"></img>
            in my childhood. I spent many hours thrashing and being thrashed by my brother and father, because I could never learn to do anything except mash buttons until I either won or lost.

            Looking back on the controller for the Atari Jaguar, you can see why there was a lot of button mashing going on.

          Over time, we got different game consoles and games, and eventually amassed quite a collection. Possibly even larger thagitn the one here:

          As time passed and the PS1 grew old, I had developed quite an affinity for a variety of different genres, and moreover, a love for video games that has stuck with me to this day.

          Though many years passed and I had many consoles, my father was always a PC gamer, and his influence pushed me to build my first gaming pc in 2011, preceding the initial release of Skyrim
          <img id="skyrim" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LpK6CcKRpe0/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Hey... you... you're finally awake."></img>
          and in Skyrim, my enjoyment of video games was piqued, quickly approaching critical mass. 
          I had found my platform, and it led me to where I am today. Skyrim, by my standards today, 
          seems very lackluster. The graphical fidelity is mediocre at best, the RPG elements are watered 
          down significantly from previous installments in the Elder Scrolls series, and there are 
          many aspects of the story that are nonsensical or simply lack the expert crafting with which 
          some other RPGs have been created, but I digress. The sandbox nature of the game lead me down other paths in gaming
          some of which... others consider unnatural. This fondness of freeform gameplay and RPG elements lead me to the following
          list of the absolute best games of all time (according to me).

          <li>Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead</li>
          <img id="cataclysm" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/k8cVzEYFfg4/maxresdefault.jpg"></img>
          <div style="font-size: x-small;color: darkolivegreen; margin-right: 10px;padding-bottom: 7%;">Cataclysm is a  rogue-like that is surpassed by very few in complexity and scope. You play as a survivor of an apocalypse of unknown origin and travel through the vast open country of New England, killing zeds, robots, ethereal creatures, and more. You occupy your time trying to break into government research facilities, mutating yourself and installing cybernetics to become an all-powerful god thing. Crush your enemies in custom-built death mobiles and set off nukes at your leisure. The world is yours to pillage and destroy as you see fit.</div>
          <li>The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</li>
          <img id = morrowind src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-I23YW0PXfks/TtRAsKkGMCI/AAAAAAAABGs/nazM_vAPbtA/s1600/Morrowind2010-03-1820-18-53-87.jpg"></img>
          <div style="font-size: x-small;color: darkolivegreen; margin-right: 10px; padding-bottom: 6%;">Morrowind may be a commonly heard name to some, while others may only recognize it by the name Elder Scrolls. It was possibly the first RPG that was accessible to the average person. I personally began playing Morrowind when I was around 11 or 12, and even now I revisit the game and play through the main quest line every few years. It is a true sandbox and you are free to kill any character, even the gods, although they can take quite a beating.
