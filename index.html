          The Galactic Republic spanned thousands of worlds for a time period
          greater than any civilization on Earth. Why would such a grand and
          expansive civilization fall, you may ask? On this page I will explore
          the many competing factions, areas of lax governmental control, and
          failures of this galaxy-spanning republic.

          The Galactic Republic is actually significantly older than the
          Galactic Republic that existed after the Battle of Coruscant. While
          the Jedi Archives date the Galactic Republic &#126;1000 years Before
          the Battle of Yavin (BBY), there was a time prior to the existence of
          the galactic senate.

          This Galactic Empire was a different theocracy than the one existing
          under Jedi rule, but was effectively the same. It punished those who
          did not abide by the laws set force by the theocracy, and vilified
          those who disagreed with their methods. This constant internal turmoil
          broke the republic through years of power changing hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, the records destroyed in the Battle of Coruscant have
          left us with little information about the so-called "High Republic",
          but we can be sure that it was significantly more developed and less
          striated than the Republic we all know and love.
