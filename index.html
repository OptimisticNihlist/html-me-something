            Video games are a long time hobby of mine, and I have many fond memories of playing games on the Atari Jaguar (most notably, Primal Rage!)
            <img id="primal-rage" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f7/Primal_Rage_flyer.jpg"></img>
            in my childhood. I spent many hours thrashing and being thrashed by my brother and father, because I could never learn to do anything except mash buttons until I either won or lost.

            Looking back on the controller for the Atari Jaguar, you can see why there was a lot of button mashing going on.

          Over time, we got different game consoles and games, and eventually amassed quite a collection. Possibly even larger than the one here:

          As time passed and the PS1 grew old, I had developed quite an affinity for a variety of different genres, and moreover, a love for video games that has stuck with me to this day.

          Though many years passed and I had many consoles, my father was always a PC gamer, and his influence pushed me to build my first gaming pc in 2011, preceding the initial release of Skyrim

          and in Skyrim, my enjoyment of video games was piqued, quickly approaching critical mass. 
          I had found my platform, and it led me to where I am today. Skyrim, by my standards today, 
          seems very lackluster. The graphical fidelity is mediocre at best, the RPG elements are watered 
          down significantly from previous installments in the Elder Scrolls series, and there are 
          many aspects of the story that are nonsensical or simply lack the expert crafting with which 
          some other RPGs have been created, but I digress. The sandbox nature of the

          Unfortunately, the records destroyed in the Battle of Coruscant have
          left us with little information about the so-called "High Republic",
          but we can be sure that it was significantly more developed and less
          striated than the Republic we all know and love.
